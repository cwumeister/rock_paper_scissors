# rock_paper_scissors
Python project of a game of rock paper scissors. 

In a function, the user is asked to input either Rock, Paper, or Scissors. If the user types in something other than the three options, it prompts the user to try again. 
In another function, a random option is assigned to the computer's response. To do this, we need to import the random library, and then use random.choice(list) where the list holds the options. 

In the main function, the inputs from the user and the random generated answer are stored into variables. Then there is an if else statement of all the combinations and responses to print out.
I recognize that this can be done since there is a finite amount of combinations, however, this would not be the ideal situation if we did not know the case.
